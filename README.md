# Scarlet

A modern and lightweight client mod for TETR.IO, with emphasis on stability.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do not report issues to TETR.IO if you have Scarlet installed.** While client mods won't get
you banned, the TETR.IO team is within their rights to block you off from support if you do so.

Scarlet is still early in development, but you can easily build it yourself:

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

Just open `dist/Scarlet.user.js` on your browser with a Userscript extension, and you're in!

## Contributing

Scarlet provides an API for mods to write their patches and custom HTML in. Scarlet mods are all
first-party, and are completely built-in. If you wish to write your own, we encourage you to
contribute your mod directly to Scarlet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Scarlet will never accept mods which affect gameplay. We look forward to improving the TETR.IO
experience, *not* promoting unfair play
